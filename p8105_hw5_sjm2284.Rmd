## Problem 1 

```{r}

same_birthday = function(n) { 
  birthday = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  return(length(birthday) != length(unique(birthday))) 
  }

n = 30 
results = same_birthday(n) 

# False -> all birthdays are unique , TRUE -> there are duplicate birthdays 

```

```{r}

simulate_probabilities = function(group_size, num_simulations) {
  results = map(1:num_simulations, ~same_birthday(group_size))
  mean(unlist(results)) }

group_sizes = 2:50 
probabilities = map_dbl(group_sizes, ~simulate_probabilities(.x, 10000))


results_table = tibble(
  group_size = group_sizes, probability = probabilities)

```

```{r}

ggplot( results_table, aes( x = group_size, y = probability)) + geom_line() + geom_point()+
  labs (
    title = "Group Size vs Probaility of Same Birthday ",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability"
  )

```
